r"""Performs the 1-D Convolutional RNN Operation, according to the paper:
  Convolutional RNN: an Enhanced Model for Extracting Features from Sequential Data (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05875)
  Gil Keren and Bjoern Schuller. 

  Calling the below function is equivalnet to applying one CRNN layer. For a deep model with a few
  CRNN layers, the function should be invoked multiple times. 

  Given a tensor, the function extracts patches of `kernel_size` time-steps, and processed each 
  with one or more recurrent layers. The hidden state of the recurrent neural network is then 
  returned as the feature vector representing the path. 

  Args:
    tensor: The tensor to perform the operation on, shape `[batch, time-steps, features]`
            or `[batch, time-steps, features, 1]`.
    kernel_size: The number of time-steps to include in every patch/window (same as in standard 1-D convolution).
    stride: the number of time-steps between two consecutive patches/windows (same as in standard 1-D convolution).
    out_channels: The number of extracted features from each patch/window (in standard 1-D convolution 
                  known as the number of feature maps), which is the hidden dimension of the recurrent 
                  layers that processes each patch/window.
    rnn_n_layers: The number of recurrent layers to process the patches/windows. 
		  (in the original paper was always =1). 
    rnn_type: Type of recurrent layers to use: `simple`/`lstm`/`gru`
    bidirectional: Whether to use a bidirectional recurrent layers (such as BLSTM, when the rnn_type is 'lstm'). 
                   If True, The actual number of extracted features from each patch/window is `2 * out_channels`.
    w_std: Weights in the recurrent layers will be initialized randomly using a Gaussaian distribution with
           zero mean and a standard deviation of `w_std`. Biases are initialized with zero. 
    padding: `SAME` or `VALID` (same as in standard 1-D convolution).
    scope_name: For variable naming, the name prefix for variables names.  

  Returns:
    A 3-D `Tensor` with shape `[batch, time-steps, features]`, similarly to the output of a standard 1-D convolution.
