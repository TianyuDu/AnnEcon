### Time series analysis and prediction with recurrent neural network

#### Introduction

In this project, we implement recurrent neural network architecture onto time series analysis. Especially, we focus on time series on <u>economic data</u>. 

This project is mainly written in [Matlab](mathwork.com) and data used in this model were downloaded from several open databases.

* St. Louis Fed (FRED) Economic data by [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org)

* IMF DataMapper by [International Monetary Fund](http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets)

* [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)
